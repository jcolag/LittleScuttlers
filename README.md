Experiments with Scuttlebutt

[Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) is a decentralized social network designed to operate well offline, and just _happens_ to have a nice community.  So, I've been messing around with the protocol to see what's possible and create some utilities that are useful to how I work.
